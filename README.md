# CLI Applications

This repository serves as a collection of all the command-line interface (CLI) applications that I create. Each application is designed to run in a terminal environment, providing functionality that simplifies various tasks through command-line commands.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each CLI application is stored in its own subdirectory within this repository. These subdirectories contain:

- Source code (`.py`, `.sh`, `.js`, etc.)
- Documentation on how to use the application
- Example usage and expected outputs

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

To use any of the CLI applications in this repository, follow these general steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/loughness/CLI-Applications.git
   cd CLI-Applications
   ```

2. **Navigate to a specific application directory**:

   ```bash
   cd application-name
   ```

3. **Follow the installation instructions** provided in the respective application's README file (if required).

## 🚀 Running an Application

Each CLI application may have different dependencies and execution methods. Check the respective application's documentation, but in general, you can run Python-based CLI applications like this:

```bash
python3 application.py
```

Or for a shell script:

```bash
./script.sh
```

## 📜 List of CLI Applications

This repository will grow as more CLI applications are added. Below is a list of currently available applications:

1. **hello_cli** - Following along with the tutorial from [Real Python](https://realpython.com) about using argparse for CLI programming.
